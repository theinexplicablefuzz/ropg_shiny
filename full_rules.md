### Character Creation
-	Create a concept and name with storyteller
-	Allocate 20 ranks to potentials with at least 1 rank in each – these determine ability maximums
- Determine the 
-	Choose 2 potentials at rank 3 or higher to be favored potentials
-	Each ability begins at rank 1
-	For each ability, gain 1 rank for each associated favored potential
-	Gain 10 experience

### Declaring Actions
1. say what you want your character to do (e.g. climb the mountain, persuade the guard,)
2. work with the ST to determine the appropriate ability and any relevant knacks.
3. If your ability is high enough, you succeed. Otherwise, roll a six-sided die and if the roll is less than the appropriate ability, you succeed. if the roll is greater, you fail and conflict may begin.

### Action Difficulty
Occasionally the Narrator will modify the difficulty, temporarily reducing or increasing the character's effective ability rank by a number. Sometimes a task is beyond the ability of the character attempting it. In these cases, the character may roll as normal, but on a roll of a 1 they must reroll, reducing the task difficulty by 2. Repeat until the character succeeds or fails to roll a 1.

### Handling conflict
If a character fails a roll, conflict begins. Conflict is broken down into short bursts or rounds in which time is a critical factor. Generally the initiating character acts first, however, whenever a character fails a non-senses ability check or takes a wound they move to the bottom of the initiative queue for the next round. At the beginning of each round, bystanders that are aware can join the conflict at the end of the round - if multiple bystanders join the same round, the narrator decides their order.

#### types of actions
All actions generally fall into one of 7 types

##### Attack
The attack action wounds a character. Any action that attempts to alter another character's physical, emotional, or mental state is considered an attack. This includes, seduction, persuasion, or confusion. The attacker must succeed on an ability check in order to attack successfully. Sometimes an attack can be unintended - for example, miscommunication while relaying information to an ally. During conflict, physical attacks that deal wounds cause the attacked character to lose one action on their next turn. Mental or social attacks cause the attacked character to act in accordance with the nature of the attack (e.g. attack if taunted, cower if threatened, flinch if frightened).

##### Reflex
Reflex action can only be used in conflict but must be used out of turn. Reflex actions are a special type of action that allows the acting character to inturrupt the current turn, borrowing an action from their next turn. To perform a reflex action, the character must have at least one action available on their next turn and succeed on a reflex check. If the check is successful, the character may act immediately before the current turn, but they have one fewer actions on their next turn. If multiple characters perform reflex actions, the narrator decides the order.

##### Contest
contest actions can only be taken by characters that are aware of conflict. The contest action allows a character to name a specific type of action and a number of targets. Until the contesting character takes another action they can attempt a successful ability check to negate actions of the chosen type that are made by a target. The contest action persists until they fail a roll. The contesting character must use the active contest action as a substitute for the action consumed by a reflex action or attack.

##### Move
Movement actions are any actions that change the location of your character. Outside of conflict rounds, distances are largely ignored. During conflict, a character can hastily walk/run up to about 10 meters (~30 feet) with a move action. larger moves or other movement methods (e.g. flips, rolls, dives, swimming, climbing, etc.) require a successful skill check.

##### Assess
Any action that attempts to gather information or formulate a plan is an assess action. While assess actions don't provide any mechanical benefit, they can suggest which approaches might be most effective – for example, an empathy assess action might reveal that . The storyteller will make assess rolls on the player’s behalf

##### Retrieve
The retrieve action is used to draw weapons, pick up or interact with a nearby item, or grab an easy to access item stored on your person. Sometimes an item may be buried in a backpack or otherwise stowed away - In cases where the object is not visible, make an awareness roll to see if you find what you are looking for.

##### Focus
Focus allows you to filter out distractions and focus on the task at hand. Make a focus ability check. If you succeed, you gain focus. While you have focus any time you make a check related to you attack, move, assess, or retrieve action, you can roll twice and take the best result. If you take a wound or make a reflex check, you must suceed on a focus check or lose focus.

### Wounds and Trauma
Whenever a character overexerts or fails to resist an attack, they take wounds which may impair them short term or even result in lasting trauma. 

#### Wounds
Each vitality ability has a specific wound type associated with it, and a character can absorb a number of wounds equal to the associated ability. When a character has taken wounds equal to the protecting ability they must roll twice and take the worst result for all check involving the associated potential. Once Injury, or Coma would exceed the associated ability, the character blacks out and goes under Narrator control. If Erosion would exceed the invigoration, the character suffers burnout and is unable to use aura abilities for a period. Fatigue, Anxiety, and Madness operate differently – if the would exceed the associated ability, the character begins taking other wounds instead (Injury, Madness & Coma, and Anxiety & Coma respectively). 

| Ability      | Potential  | Wound   | Further Damage |
|--------------|:-----------|:--------|:---------------|
| Resilience   | Intellect  | Madness | Anxiety & Coma |
| Composure    | Charisma   | Anxiety | Madness & Coma |
| Endurance    | Physique   | Fatigue | Injury         | 
| Hardiness    | Vitality   | Injury  | Unconcious     |
| Focus        | Senses     | Coma    | Unconcious     |
| Invigoration | Aura       | Erosion | Burnout        |

#### Trauma
After conflict ends characters have a chance to recover from their wounds, however there is a chance for lasting trauma. Make one ability check for each wound - for each success, reduce the number of wounds by one. Then make a "wounds"" check by rolling against the number of remaining wounds - if successful, the character has sustained some sort of long-term trauma. The storyteller and player should work together to determine the nature of the character's trauma.

## Character Creation

### Process
-	Create a concept and name with storyteller
-	Allocate 20 ranks to potentials with at least 1 rank in each – these determine ability maximums
-	Choose 2 potentials at rank 3 or higher to be favored potentials
-	Each ability begins at rank 1
-	For each ability, gain 1 rank for each associated favored potential
-	Gain 10 experience

### Potentials
Potentials represent your character's theoretical limists - no ability can be raised higher than the lowest of its two corresponding potentials. There are six potentials - Charisma, Intellect, Physique, Senses, Vitality, and Aura - with each potential corresponding to one pure facet of human experience. 
 - Charisma is a character's force of personality and social prowess. 
 - Intellect is a character's smarts and mental capability.  
 - Physique represents strength, agility, and physical ability.  
 - Senses represents a character's perceptiveness and alertness.  
 - Vitality is a character's self-ness and ability to resist change or influence.  
 - Aura represents a character's magical and spiritual ability.
 
Characters begin with 20 points to allocate among potentials but must have at least 1 rank in each potential. Players have the choice of focusing on complete mastery of a few abilities, partial mastery of many abilities or something in between - Specialists can reach the peaks of human ability in their specializations, but generalists will be more capable on average.

### Abilities
Each ability is composed of exactly two potentials and no ability can be raised higher than the lowest of its two corresponding potentials.

## Advice for Narrators

### Thematic guidance
- Quick and bloody combat makes the characters wary of fighting
- no critical system, use called shots to suggest traumas
- use "super" knack to create imbalance. 
- human scale system

### Aura Backlash
All magic that is not a knack requires a successful Aura ability roll. Unlike other ability checks, failed aura checks result in a backlash, with the summoned magical energies running amok or rebounding on the caster - the narrator should feel free to use failed magic rolls to introduce unexpected effects, create story hooks, or inflict erosion damage on the caster. Powerful magic should be more difficult to perform, with particulary powerful magic requiring multiple successes.

### Customizing Realms

#### Low/No Magic Realms
Select a level between 0 and 5 for the magic suppression for your realm. Magic suppression reduces the effective potential of all aura for the realm Magic suppression of 2 means that at most a character can raise Aura abilities to 3 but that character would still need to have 5 ranks in Aura. Give each character that starts in such a realm additional experience equal to n(n+1)/2 where n is the lesser of ranks invested in Aura and level of magic suppression. In addition, If a character selected Aura as one of their primary potentials give them 0,3,15,or 21 experience dependingin on whether whether magic suppression reduces their max rank to 3+,2,1,or 0 respectively. If these characters somehow transition to a higher magic environment, their effective potential is increased and they can improve Aura abilities up to their new effectiv potential. 

If characters somehow transition to a lower magic environment, they find that they can no longer perform magic to the same level they could prior - all Aura abilities have their effective ranks reduced by the magic suppression rating. Additionally, the narrator may determine that magic is temporarily more challenging to perform due to the unfamiliar difficulty.

#### Augmented magic realms
In addition to low magic, some realms have augmented magic. these places are inherently unstable with the slightest hint of magical will sending cascading effects throughout the realm. Characters in these areas will need to be on guard or else these chaotic planes will warp them mind body and soul. In addition, the magical energies gradually wear upon the soul of the characters, inflicting erosion damage as their auras wear and fray at the edges.
