# Ruins of past glory

## Character Creation
-	Create a concept and name with storyteller
-	Allocate 20 ranks to potentials with at least 1 rank in each – these determine ability maximums
- Determine the 
-	Choose 2 potentials at rank 3 or higher to be favored potentials
-	Each ability begins at rank 1
-	For each ability, gain 1 rank for each associated favored potential
-	Gain 10 experience

### Potentials
Potentials represent your character's theoretical limists - no ability can be raised higher than the lowest of its two corresponding potentials. There are six potentials - Charisma, Intellect, Physique, Senses, Vitality, and Aura - with each potential corresponding to one pure facet of human experience. 
 - Charisma is a character's force of personality and social prowess. 
 - Intellect is a character's smarts and mental capability.  
 - Physique represents strength, agility, and physical ability.  
 - Senses represents a character's perceptiveness and alertness.  
 - Vitality is a character's self-ness and ability to resist change or influence.  
 - Aura represents a character's magical and spiritual ability.
 
Characters begin with 20 points to allocate among potentials but must have at least 1 rank in each potential. Players have the choice of focusing on complete mastery of a few abilities, partial mastery of many abilities or something in between - Specialists can reach the peaks of human ability in their specializations, but generalists will be more capable on average.

### Abilities
Each ability is composed of exactly two potentials and no ability can be raised higher than the lowest of its two corresponding potentials.

#### Allure
Allure embodies a characters attractiveness and manipulative power. If your character has a high allure rating, you may find it easy to get others to like you. With Allure, you can use your charms to get people to trust you despite their better judgment. Allure is used to seduce, mislead or impersonate using non-verbal communication. Allure can also be used to appear unassuming or to draw attention to or away from you. All uses of allure involve putting the target (or mark) at ease

#### Athleticism
Athleticism is a character's ability to lift, run, jump, and throw a punch. If your character has high athleticism rating you may find it easy to engage in physical activities and perform feats of strength. Athleticism is used for most physical melee attacks. Athleticism also determines the maximum weight of gear your character can use effectively.

#### Awareness
Awareness is used to observe surroundings using sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell. It is the ability used to notice ambushes and traps, see returning heroes on the horizon, eavesdrop on a conversation, or find your sewing kit in a cluttered pack. If your character has a high awareness rating, you may find you notice things that others might miss and your enemies will find you hard to catch off-guard. Awareness may give you a better chance of noticing threats and attacks.

#### Composure
Composure is a character's ability to resist social pressure and keep calm when threatened. If your character has high composure rating, enemies may find you hard to rile and shop keepers will find you difficult to upsell. Composure is the social defensive ability and is related to *Anxiety* wounds.

## How to Play

### Declaring Actions
1. say what you want your character to do (e.g. climb the mountain, persuade the guard,)
2. work with the ST to determine the appropriate ability and any relevant knacks.
3. While not in conflict, If your ability is high enough, you succeed. Otherwise, roll a six-sided die and if the roll is less than the appropriate ability, you succeed. if the roll is greater, you fail and conflict begins if it has not already.

### Action Difficulty
Occasionally the Narrator will modify the difficulty, temporarily reducing or increasing the character's effective ability rank by a number. Sometimes a task is beyond the ability of the character attempting it. In these cases, the character may roll as normal, but on a roll of a 1 they must reroll, reducing the task difficulty by 2. Repeat until the character succeeds or fails to roll a 1.

### Handling conflict
If a character fails a roll, conflict begins. Conflict is broken down into short bursts or rounds in which time is a critical factor. Generally the initiating character acts first, however, whenever a character fails a non-senses ability check or takes a wound they move to the bottom of the initiative queue for the next round. At the beginning of each round, bystanders that are aware can join the conflict at the end of the round - if multiple bystanders join the same round, the narrator decides their order.

#### types of actions
All actions generally fall into one of 7 types

##### Attack
The attack action wounds a character. Any action that attempts to alter another character's physical, emotional, or mental state is considered an attack. This includes, seduction, persuasion, or confusion. The attacker must succeed on an ability check in order to attack successfully. Sometimes an attack can be unintended - for example, miscommunication while relaying information to an ally. During conflict, physical attacks that deal wounds cause the attacked character to lose one action on their next turn. Mental or social attacks cause the attacked character to act in accordance with the nature of the attack (e.g. attack if taunted, cower if threatened, flinch if frightened).

##### Reflex
Reflex action can only be used in conflict but must be used out of turn. Reflex actions are a special type of action that allows the acting character to inturrupt the current turn, borrowing an action from their next turn. To perform a reflex action, the character must have at least one action available on their next turn and succeed on a reflex check. If the check is successful, the character may act immediately before the current turn, but they have one fewer actions on their next turn. If multiple characters perform reflex actions, the narrator decides the order.

##### Contest
contest actions can only be taken by characters that are aware of conflict. The contest action allows a character to name a specific type of action and a number of targets. Until the contesting character takes another action they can attempt a successful ability check to negate actions of the chosen type that are made by a target. The contest action persists until they fail a roll. The contesting character must use the active contest action as a substitute for the action consumed by a reflex action or attack.

##### Move
Movement actions are any actions that change the location of your character. Outside of conflict rounds, distances are largely ignored. During conflict, a character can hastily walk/run up to about 10 meters (~30 feet) with a move action. larger moves or other movement methods (e.g. flips, rolls, dives, swimming, climbing, etc.) require a successful skill check.

##### Assess
Any action that attempts to gather information or formulate a plan is an assess action. While assess actions don't provide any mechanical benefit, they can suggest which approaches might be most effective – for example, an empathy assess action might reveal that . The storyteller will make assess rolls on the player’s behalf

##### Retrieve
The retrieve action is used to draw weapons, pick up or interact with a nearby item, or grab an easy to access item stored on your person. Sometimes an item may be buried in a backpack or otherwise stowed away - In cases where the object is not visible, make an awareness roll to see if you find what you are looking for.

##### Focus
Focus allows you to filter out distractions and focus on the task at hand. Make a focus ability check. If you succeed, you gain focus. While you have focus any time you make a check related to you attack, move, assess, or retrieve action, you can roll twice and take the best result. If you take a wound or make a reflex check, you must suceed on a focus check or lose focus.

### Stunts, Rituals, and Knacks

#### Stunts
Sometimes a character may want to combine multiple effects into a single action. To perform a stunt, the character must state how many different effects they are attempting to combine to determine the number of successes required. All rolls must be successul in order to pull of a stunt. The narrator determines the ordering of effects as well as what happens with a failed stunt.

- 1st effect: 1 success
- 2nd effect: 2 successes
- 3rd effect: 3 successes

#### Rituals
rituals are like stunts except that the successes can occur over a long period of time before the final effect takes place. Rituals require a number of effects to succeed with each effect taking one action. If the character performing the ritual does not gain at least one success on each turn, the ritual fails. if the character fails any roll to perform a ritual, the ritual fails. Stunts can be used to hasten rituals following stunt rules. If a ritual fails, the narrator determines the outcome.

#### Knacks & flaws
Knacks represent a character's special talents or skills that manifest under certain conditions. If a character has a knack, then they automatically succeed on related checks as long as their effective ability rank would be 3 or greater. To gain a knack, the character pays an experience cost to describe what their character learned, what conditions they require, and where they learned it from. If a knack becomes unbalancing, the narrator may impose flaws or request additional experience. Stunts can be made into knacks at a cost of 1 experience per success required, and the total number of successes required to perform a stunt can be reduced by relevant knacks. 

### Gear
Gear is either given by the storyteller through play or purchased using experience. Some gear provides the possessing character with a knack that is typically dependent on posession of the item. Gear knacks require experience to learn to use.

#### Weapons, Armor, and shields
weapons and armor have two primary characteristics - weight and quality. Weight determines how many ranks in atheletics are required to use the item - to use an item that is too heavy, the character must succeed on a athletics roll before making any attempts with the item. Weight is used to determine a weapon's secondary characteristics - coverage and density for armor, mass and penetration for weapons. 

Quality increases the effective weight of a piece of gear allowing a light, but high quality piece of gear to provide the same benefits as heavier normal quality gear. Improvised gear is typically -1 quality, causing it to be less effective for it's weight. If a piece of gear would be reduced to quality -2, it breaks into two or more improvised weapons

| Quality    | mod |
|------------|:---:|
| Inferior   | -1  |
| Normal     | +0  |
| Good       | +1  |
| Superior   | +2  |
| Excellent  | +3  |

##### Armor
Armors divide effective weight +2 among density and coverage. When a character would be hit by an attack, a successful coverage check allows the armor to absorb a number of wounds up to the armor's density value. If the armor succeeds on coverage but is unable to block all of the wounds, the armor must succeed on a density check or lose one quality. Multiple sources of armor can each provide a separate coverage check. Normally, a character can only benefit from one armor and one shield at a time, but may also benefit from armor granted by terrain.

| Armor        | Weight | Cov  | Den |
|--------------|:------:|:----:|:---:|
| Padded Cloth | 1      | 2    | 1   |
| Leather      | 2      | 2    | 2   |
| Chainshirt   | 3      | 3    | 2   |
| Breastplate  | 3      | 2    | 3   |
| Half-plate*  | 4      | 2    | 4   |
| Fullplate*   | 5      | 3    | 4   |
*damaged. plate would normally be superior or excellent quality

##### Weapons
Weapons divide weight among mass and penetration. Mass is added to wounds on a successful hit so generally wounds = mass + 1 . Weapons ignore armor with density less than the weapon's penetration score. If multiple armors would apply, the weapon's penetration value reduces by the density of each item it penetrates. Ammunition augments the mass and penetration values of the firing weapon, however, ammunition can only be effectively used with weapons with a mass greater than their weight.

| Weapon     | Weight | Mass | Pen |
|------------|:------:|:----:|:---:|
| Staff      | 1      | 1    | 0   |
| Dagger     | 1      | 0    | 1   |
| Arrow/Bolt | 1      | 0    | 1   |
| Shortbow   | 2      | 1    | 1   |
| Spear      | 2      | 0    | 2   |
| Shortsword | 2      | 0    | 2   |
| Crossbow   | 3      | 1    | 2   |
| Longsword  | 3      | 2    | 1   |
| Battleaxe  | 3      | 1    | 2   |
| Zweihander | 4      | 3    | 1   |
| Halberd    | 4      | 1    | 3   |
| Warhammer  | 4      | 2    | 2   |


### Vitality, Wounds, and Trauma
Whenever a character overexerts or fails to resist an attack, they take wounds which may impair them short term or even result in lasting trauma. 

#### Vitality
Each vitality ability has a specific wound type associated with it. When a character would be dealt one or more wounds, they have a chance to resist each wound by making a successful vitality ability check of the type associated with the attack. For example, if a character would take 2 intellect wounds from a terror attack, they may make two resilience checks, one for each wound. each success reduces the total number of wounds dealt by the attack by one.

#### Wounds
A character can absorb a number of wounds equal to the associated ability. When a character has taken wounds equal to the protecting ability they must roll twice and take the worst result for all check involving the associated potential. Once Injury, or Coma would exceed the associated ability, the character blacks out and goes under Narrator control. If Erosion would exceed the invigoration, the character suffers burnout and is unable to use aura abilities for a period. Fatigue, Anxiety, and Madness operate differently – if the would exceed the associated ability, the character begins taking other wounds instead (Injury, Madness & Coma, and Anxiety & Coma respectively). 

| Ability      | Potential  | Wound   | Further Damage |
|--------------|:-----------|:--------|:---------------|
| Resilience   | Intellect  | Madness | Anxiety & Coma |
| Composure    | Charisma   | Anxiety | Madness & Coma |
| Endurance    | Physique   | Fatigue | Injury         | 
| Hardiness    | Vitality   | Injury  | Unconcious     |
| Focus        | Senses     | Coma    | Unconcious     |
| Invigoration | Aura       | Erosion | Burnout        |

#### Trauma
After conflict ends characters have a chance to recover from their wounds, however there is a chance for lasting trauma. Make one ability check for each wound - for each success, reduce the number of wounds by one. Then make a "wounds"" check by rolling against the number of remaining wounds - if successful, the character has sustained some sort of long-term trauma. The storyteller and player should work together to determine the nature of the character's trauma.

## Advice for Narrators

### Thematic guidance
- Quick and bloody combat makes the characters wary of fighting
- no critical system, use called shots to suggest traumas
- use "super" knack to create imbalance. 
- human scale system

### Aura Backlash
Unlike other ability checks, failed aura checks result in a backlash, with the summoned magical energies running amok or rebounding on the caster - the narrator should feel free to use failed magic rolls to introduce unexpected effects, create story hooks, or inflict erosion damage on the caster. Powerful magic should be more difficult to perform, with particulary powerful magic requiring multiple successes.

### Customizing Realms

#### Low/No Magic Realms
Select a level between 0 and 5 for the magic suppression for your realm. Magic suppression reduces the effective potential of all aura for the realm Magic suppression of 2 means that at most a character can raise Aura abilities to 3 but that character would still need to have 5 ranks in Aura. Give each character that starts in such a realm additional experience equal to n(n+1)/2 where n is the lesser of ranks invested in Aura and level of magic suppression. In addition, If a character selected Aura as one of their primary potentials give them 0,3,15,or 21 experience dependingin on whether whether magic suppression reduces their max rank to 3+,2,1,or 0 respectively. If these characters somehow transition to a higher magic environment, their effective potential is increased and they can improve Aura abilities up to their new effectiv potential. 

If characters somehow transition to a lower magic environment, they find that they can no longer perform magic to the same level they could prior - all Aura abilities have their effective ranks reduced by the magic suppression rating. Additionally, the narrator may determine that magic is temporarily more challenging to perform due to the unfamiliar difficulty.

#### Augmented magic realms
In addition to low magic, some realms have augmented magic. these places are inherently unstable with the slightest hint of magical will sending cascading effects throughout the realm. Characters in these areas will need to be on guard or else these chaotic planes will warp them mind body and soul. In addition, the magical energies gradually wear upon the soul of the characters, inflicting erosion damage as their auras wear and fray at the edges.
